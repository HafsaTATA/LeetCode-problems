# Intuition
I initiated the process by examining each word in the given list. The objective was to find the first occurrence of a palindrome word among them.
# Approach
I implemented a method to check if a word is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends. This method enabled the identification of palindromes.

# Complexity
### Time complexity:

    O(n×m)O(n×m) where n is the number of words in the input list and m the length of each word.
### Space complexity:
    O(1)
The algorithm utilizes a minimal amount of additional space. It only requires space to store a few variables and does not scale with the input size.
