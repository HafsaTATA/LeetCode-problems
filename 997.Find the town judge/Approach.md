I started by separating the people who trust others so I could easily identify the judge, given that the judge doesn't trust anybody. Then, I created a hashmap to keep track of people who are trusted, considering the frequency because it's crucial for the judge to be trusted by EVRYONE(n-1). Finally, I used a loop to conduct my tests. Firstly, I checked that the judge wasn't among those who trust others. Then, I verified if the judge was trusted by everyone.
