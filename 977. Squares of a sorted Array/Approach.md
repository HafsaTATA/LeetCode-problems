# Approach 
To solve the problem efficiently, I chose a two-pointer approach due to the sorted nature of the input array. This method involves initializing pointers left and right to traverse the array from its ends, enabling quick comparison and processing. Recognizing that the squares maintain the non-decreasing order, I opted for a reverse iteration over the resultant array

:bangbang: In terms of performance, using **direct multiplication** is generally more efficient than using **Math.pow()** method.
